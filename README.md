# HiBoP Python API

This Python API is meant to be used to create complete projects for [HiBoP](https://github.com/hbp-HiBoP/HiBoP). It eases the creation of all the required files to make a working HiBoP project from your database, no matter how it is organised.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and start writing Python code importing the different files of this API. You can take a look at the [sample.py](https://github.com/hbp-HiBoP/HiBoP-Python-API/blob/master/sample.py) file in order to see how it works.
